ironsworn-handsfree is a set of iOS Shortcuts for all of the Ironsworn Oracles plus the Challenge roll.  You can either run the Shortcuts manually or via Siri's voice control.

# History

I'm preparing for an extended road trip and thought it would be fun to play some Ironsworn along the way.  Of course, I can't roll dice, update character sheets, etc. while driving.  But I realized I could convert the Oracles to Siri-driven Shortcuts and then use voice control to play in the car.

# Limitations

- None of the multiple-roll results (e.g., "roll twice") are modeled - they are simply excluded.
- Oracle 7, which is the more detailed Settlement Name Generator, is not included.  However, the Ironsworn Names shortcut can generate Settlement Quick Names.
- I am not the world's greatest Shortcuts programmer, so some of this code is likely suboptimal.
- There are likely typos and bugs.

# Future Improvements

It may be possible to use Siri to keep and update stats.  It can of course be done if you write a web app and use Shortcuts to interact with it, but also perhaps possible with something like Tally.

# The Shortcuts

Note that you will need to go to Settings->Shortcuts and check "Allow Untusted Shortcuts" in order to import these shortcuts.
